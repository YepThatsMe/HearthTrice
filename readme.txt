HearthTrice Manager v1.4

HOW TO USE:
To add custom hearthstone cards to Cockatrice database:

1) Create a new .xml template with 'File --> Create blank (Ctrl+N)' in .../Cockatrice/data/customsets/ folder. If you already have an .xml library, open it for editing with 'File --> Open (Ctrl+O)' from the same directory.

2) Visit http://www.hearthcards.net/mycards/ and make sure your gallery is open by checking the box on the right. There you will find the link to your public gallery which looks like this: http://www.hearthcards.net/mycards/?cards=XXXXX . The last few digits of the link is your gallery ID.

3) Enter your ID in the form on the top and hit 'Import'. All your cards will be collected from hearthcards.net and displayed on the screen.

4) Then you need to assign each card its name and type by which Cockatrice will recognize it and add them to the library. All library contents will be updated as you add and shown on the list. 
(You may leave 'None' as type since it serves only for filtering purposes, except for Tokens, those are added to token library and can be created in-game with Ctrl+T).

5*) Finally, open Cockatrice, then 'Card Database --> Add custom sets/cards', and pick your file. 
*You can do this step once, after updating your .xml library all new cards will be added to Cockatrice Database automatically.
